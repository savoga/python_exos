# Geolocalisation Data Challenge

## Objective

A company that produces connected device needs to locate the position of their device. They could use GPS but using prediction based on data seems cheaper.
Prediction is based on the message reception information.

## Inputs

Inputs are different information about messages:

Note: _rssi_ (Received Signal Strength Indicator) is an estimation of the signal power level received by the device.

Note: we won't use column _nseq_ and _time_ux_.

##Â Outputs

Outputs are the localisation (latitude and longitude) of the located device:
