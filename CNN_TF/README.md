## ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLE FOR CNN ##

In this project analyze how we can fool a CNN while recognizing the gender of a person in a photo.

We use nn4 algorithm.

Step 1: Train the model and save it
Step 2: Find my own image and vectorize it
Step 3: Change label associated with this new image
Step 4: Create a "disruption" vector DX
Step 5: Learn the model w.r.t DX based on the initial image
