{\fontsize{12pt}{22pt} \textbf{ROC curve}\par}

\vspace{5mm}

ROC = Receiver Operating Curve

ROC curve is used essentially for binary classification.

\underline{Use of the ROC curve}

\vspace{5mm}

One model:

We use ROC curve to evaluate the performance of one classifying model that we can obtain when varying a threshold.

\vspace{5mm}

Several models:

We use ROC curve to compare several classifying models in evaluating the area under the curve (AUC) for a range of threshold.

\underline{Intuition}

\vspace{5mm}

After running the prediction of a specific model, we draw the confusion matrix (actual vs predited) with a certain threshold.

\vspace{5mm}

We then modify the threshold and draw another confusion matrix.

The ROC graph summarizes all of the confusion matrices that each threshold produced.

On the left picture we see the ability of a model to give a clear distinction between the two classes. The curves are drawn from the predictions and the actual results)

\underline{Implementation}

\vspace{5mm}

1. Get probability predictions

2. Sort the probabilities (prediction)

3. Sort the validation (actual) according to previous sort

4. Loop on the sorted validation. At each iteration:

- increment TP or FP

- compute the TPR and FPR.

5. Plot (FPR, TPR)
