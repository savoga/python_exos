Objectivism: the probability of an event is determined in a unique manner.

Subjectivism: the probability of an event is not determined in a unique manner.

Bayesianism is a probabilistic theory part of the subjectivism. It states that a probability varies depending on new information (Bayes theorem).

In Bayesian inference, random variables are $X$. $\theta$ is not random and not known. The objective is to estimate $\theta$ using \textit{a-posteriori} probabilities.
